# Magic Words
A silly phrase generator. :)
Phrases that have previously been printed out are remembered by the program and will not be printed in future sessions.

Use `python magic.py` to begin interacting with this program!

## Structure
* `magic.py`: The main file, interacted with via command line
* `create_magic.py`: Creates phrases based on combinations of words in `input.txt`. There are regex patterns that
parse the input and places inputted words into buckets, from which the combos are generated.
* `get_magic.py`: Prints out the phrases generated by `create_magic.py`. Woah oh ohhhhhh it's magic!
* `input.txt`: A list of words to be turned into m a g i c. Words separated by newlines; `#` marks comments.
